Face-Recognition-Attendance-System

Description:
A modern attendance system using face recognition technology to automate and streamline attendance tracking. This system replaces traditional roll-call methods with an AI-powered solution that identifies and records attendance in real time using facial recognition.

Key Features:
âœ… Real-time Face Detection & Recognition â€“ Uses OpenCV, Dlib, or Deep Learning models (like FaceNet) to detect and recognize faces.
âœ… Automated Attendance Logging â€“ Records attendance in a database (SQLite, MySQL, or CSV) with timestamps.
âœ… User Registration â€“ Allows admin to register new users by capturing facial data.
âœ… Attendance Reports â€“ Generates attendance reports (Excel/PDF) for easy tracking.
âœ… Multi-platform Support â€“ Can be deployed on Windows, Linux, or Raspberry Pi.
âœ… Security & Anti-Spoofing â€“ Optional liveness detection to prevent fake attendance.

Technologies Used:
Python (Primary Language)

OpenCV (Face Detection)

Face Recognition Libraries (Dlib, DeepFace, or TensorFlow/Keras)

Database (SQLite/MySQL/Firebase)

Flask/Django (Optional Web Interface)

Use Cases:
Schools & Universities

Corporate Offices

Events & Conferences

Remote Work Attendance Tracking

How to Use:

Clone the repository.

Install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt).
